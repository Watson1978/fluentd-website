## Running it locally

```
$ bundle install --path vendor
$ bundle exec rake server
```

## Blog

- Each blog entry is a single file under content/blog/yyyy/MM/dd/slugified-name.md
- Blog entries can be written in the GitHub flavored markdown format.
- If you want to add a tag, add a line at the end like this:
    ```
    TAG: tag1 tag2 tag3
    ```
- Before you push to master, make sure you run
    ```
    bundle exec rake update_tags
    ```

This must be the world's most sophisticated blog system.
